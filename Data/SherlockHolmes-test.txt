He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way . 
She could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man . 
That is a possible solution — in fact , as matters stand , it is the most probable one . 
Certainly not . 
I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table . 
before seeing him . 
he cried , and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back , limp and helpless , in the chair . 
It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her . 
Then Mr. Angel began to call , for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced . 
With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him . 
You have the photograph ? 
You said ten miles , I think , sir . 
Ah , but I was recommended to you . 
Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle . 
No friend of yours , Miss Hunter ? 
If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets . 
Lestrade looked sadly at my companion . 
More than that . 
Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel . 
Quite so . 
I’ve wasted time enough , said Lestrade , rising . 
To carry the art , however , to its highest pitch , it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge ; and this in itself implies , as you will readily see , a possession of all knowledge , which , even in these days of free education and encyclopædias , is a somewhat rare accomplishment . 
What can I do for you , Mr. Holmes ? 
Could you swear to it ? 
I distinctly saw his bare throat . 
Have the goodness , also , when you address me always to say sir and please . 
I have already offered a reward of £ 1000 . 
Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature . 
Dearest do not be frightened . 
Then he tried the various keys in the lock , but without success . 
She smiled back at me , closed my door , and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock . 
When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates , and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire . 
He didn’t mind me ; in fact , he took a fancy to me , for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so . 
I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you . 
I had an idea that he might , and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me . 
But look at these lonely houses , each in its own fields , filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law . 
Oh , says she , we’ve set yours aside for you — Jem’s bird , we call it . 
Then here are the father’s feet as he paced up and down . 
It was only a joke at first , groaned our visitor . 
It was twenty - five minutes to twelve , and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind . 
Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it . 
It was very nice and complimentary of you , Holmes answered . 
I had not gone more than 150 yards , however , when I heard a hideous outcry behind me , which caused me to run back again . 
And now there is only she to be described . 
Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river , and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street . 
Is it not a pity that she was not on my level ? 
Inspector Bradstreet would , I am sure , make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities . 
Oh , yes , with the deepest interest . 
They are all , as he remarks , very much against the son . 
For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot . 
Well , let us hope so . 
With hardly a word spoken , but with a kindly eye , he waved me to an armchair , threw across his case of cigars , and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner . 
We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in . 
Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house . 
One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five , and the other at the first , third , and fifth . 
My heart turned to water , for there was no sign of the stone , and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred . 
As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper . 
You look dissatisfied . 
Beyond the mention of pips , I do not see that it helps us much . 
When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business ; but it’s Where are the geese ? and Who did you sell the geese to ? and What will you take for the geese ? 
Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B , Baker Street . 
I am sorry to have interrupted you . 
There was nothing . 
Not a bit , Doctor . 
I am for west , remarked the plain - clothes man . 
Let me see , said Holmes , standing at the corner and glancing along the line , I should like just to remember the order of the houses here . 
And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill , which interests me deeply . 
To - morrow I shall set to work upon your case . 
I will do nothing of the kind . 
Holmes ! 
Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack . 
Only one little item in another of the morning papers , but it is a suggestive one . 
If she had , it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely . 
My last client of the sort was a king . 
The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him , but he still refused to raise his eyes . 
They are never sold upon hats . 
I shall communicate with you . 
Also , by the way , that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house . 
Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard , and , looking out of my window , I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard , though I was not aware in which direction he was going . 
This man strikes even deeper , but I think , Watson , that we shall be able to strike deeper still . 
He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman . 
Was it possible that we could bring him back to her ? 
Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled . 
We shall now see how the electric - blue dress will become you . 
There is a well - known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway’s , and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me . 
He must guard himself , for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track . 
I left the breakfast - table , and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key , which must have belonged to the attic , in one hand , and a small brass box , like a cashbox , in the other . 
In the cells . 
my dear young lady!’—you can not think how caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and 
I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman . 
And now , Doctor , perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb , or rather to the place where my thumb used to be . 
We lunch at Swindon , and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes . 
I think that there was probably some more tangible cause . 
I answered that I had not . 
Very good . 
Extremely so . 
But what is that compared with the number of your successes ? 
I will leave the country , sir . 
Quite so . 
They drove away in different directions , and I went off to make my own arrangements . 
Well , certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis , said Holmes , smiling . 
You have really got it ! 
Pooh , pooh ! 
There will call upon you to - night , at a quarter to eight o’clock , it said , a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment . 
How did your mother take the matter ? 
Breckinridge is his name . 
There are only two , a man and his wife . 
And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year , with what you earn into the bargain , you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way . 
It is , of course , well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors . 
No ; but one of them was mine all the same , whined the little man . 
When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me , and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople , so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house . 
Have you heard anything of the case ? he asked . 
It was a curious way of managing it , but , really , it would be difficult to suggest a better . 
He came back alone , for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town . 
She would rush to secure it . 
Set the pips on McCauley , Paramore , and John Swain of St. Augustine . 
It must stop here , however , said Bradstreet . 
I could hardly imagine a more damning case , I remarked . 
Was he in favour of such a union ? 
Pray take the basket - chair . 
Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet , but I thought it better not to disturb it . 
Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion . 
It is quite a pretty little problem , said he . 
What’s in here ? 
Then I walked across to the window , hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country - side , but an oak shutter , heavily barred , was folded across it . 
Now carry out my orders to the letter . 
I know you , you scoundrel ! 
Yes , I answered , laughing . 
The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward , while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians . 
Flora was a dear little thing , but exceedingly hot - headed and devotedly attached to me . 
You see all these isolated facts , together with many minor ones , all pointed in the same direction . 
We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves . 
Come in ! 
That is why I was so out of breath , for I am a man who takes very little exercise .
